# IntersectionObserver-Test
A test web page as a proof of concept for the IntersectionObserver object. A great tool for lazy-loading images or elements. This particular examples animates fade-in of elements as they are scrolled to within the browser window. IntersectionObserver is a much more efficient tool to use opposed to getBoundingClientRect because it is asynchronous and won't constantly run on the main thread.
